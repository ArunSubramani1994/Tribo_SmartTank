********* 300 Litre Tank ********

Let me help you calculate the volume of a cylinder with diameter 750 mm and height 750 mm.
Formula for cylinder volume: V = π × r² × h
where:

r is the radius (diameter/2)
h is the height

Step 1: Calculate radius
r = 750 mm ÷ 2 = 375 mm
Step 2: Calculate volume
V = π × (375 mm)² × 750 mm
V = 3.14159 × 140,625 mm² × 750 mm
V = 331,054,687.5 mm³
Converting to liters (1 L = 1,000,000 mm³):
V = 331.05 L

****************************

Let me help calculate the volume of a cylinder with a sloped bottom. This is known as an oblique cylinder.
For this case:

Diameter = 750 mm
Height 1 (h1) = 715 mm
Height 2 (h2) = 750 mm

For an oblique cylinder, we use the average height to calculate volume:
Average height = (h1 + h2) ÷ 2
Average height = (715 + 750) ÷ 2 = 732.5 mm
Now calculate the volume:
V = π × r² × h_average
where r = 750/2 = 375 mm
V = 3.14159 × (375)² × 732.5 mm
V = 3.14159 × 140,625 × 732.5
V = 323,404,353.1 mm³
Converting to liters:
V = 323.40 L


******************************

Let me calculate the liters per centimeter (L/cm) for this cylindrical tank.
Using the cylinder formula:
V = π × r² × h
where r = 375mm = 37.5cm
For 1cm height:
V = 3.14159 × (37.5cm)² × 1cm
V = 3.14159 × 1406.25 × 1
V = 4.41 L/cm

  hi I am working on a project  which is basically a tank level measurement that is a milk tank in that there is a agitator and the agitator is constantly steering so when it is steering and the milk inside the tank also getting stirred and there is a temperature sensor which measures the temperature of the milk and I am going to create a new level sensor which is based on time of flight which is from wave share,  so this the data from the sensor has to be given to the new ESP 32 device and the data from the sensor has to send to the internet. in the internet I have a web page which keeps on reading the data and it has to show the live data. live data has to record the readings to a database so the database from the database I could able to select the date and time when I need to export the data into Excel so in the web page has to contain this functionality and also whenever I want to call to a certain person this has to be added so that whenever there is an alarm it has to call the particular user and also whenever there is alarm it has to be logged on alarm as well as on of events has to be logged in the web page all the details can be viewed from anywhere so you please create me a quotation which consider the Tof sensor cost ESP 32 and installation as well as web page development server cost mqtt development charges and are you think about what are the necessary things has to be included for this project and give me the best quote and help me to create a best quote.  in this there is an existing hmi so I need to interact with the hmi to get the parameters through the marvelous Rs 485 and those data also sent to the server so main thing is I need to you please list on all the components which can be useful and also create help me to create the quotations

  Scope of Work: Milk Tank Level Measurement System

Objective

To design, develop, and implement a milk tank level measurement system integrated with an IoT Master Controller, capable of measuring milk level and interacting with an HMI from Selec to obtain additional parameters. The system will transmit live data to a webpage, log events and alarms, and support viewing data on a smart TV or a streaming device.

Key Deliverables

Hardware Implementation

Installation of a ToF sensor for milk level measurement.

Integration of an IoT Master Controller for data processing and communication.

Interfacing with the HMI (provided by Selec) via RS485 to fetch:

Temperature from two sensors.

Agitator on/off status.

Temperature set points and hysteresis.

Setup of a Wi-Fi router for internet connectivity.

Wiring, cabling, and housing the components in a protective enclosure.

Provision for displaying tank level data on a smart TV. If a smart TV is not available, a streaming device (e.g., Chromecast, Fire TV Stick) will be included.

Software Development

IoT Master Controller Firmware:

Acquire data from the ToF sensor.

Fetch parameters from the HMI via RS485 with Selec's support.

Transmit sensor data and parameters to a remote server using MQTT.

Web Application:

Display live data (milk level and temperature from two sensors) in a user-friendly interface.

Log alarms, events, and sensor readings in a database.

Provide options to export historical data to Excel by selecting date and time.

Allow configuration of alert thresholds and user notifications.

Enable remote viewing and management of data from any location.

Database Setup:

Design and configure a database for storing sensor data, events, and alarms.

Alarm Notification System:

Implement a system to trigger phone calls or SMS notifications to specific users in case of alarms.

Testing and Validation

Verify sensor accuracy in a stirred milk environment.

Test data transmission over Wi-Fi and MQTT.

Validate webpage functionality, including live updates, logging, and Excel exports.

Ensure seamless communication with the HMI via RS485 with Selec’s support.

Deployment and Installation

Assemble and install the system at the client’s site.

Configure the hardware and software for optimal performance.

Provide user training and documentation for system operation.

Post-Deployment Support

Offer a warranty period for addressing hardware or software issues.

Provide options for additional support or upgrades as needed.

Responsibilities

Vendor:

Supply all required hardware components.

Develop and deploy firmware and software.

Conduct installation and testing.

Provide documentation and training.

Client:

Facilitate access to the installation site.

Ensure availability of a stable internet connection.

Provide a smart TV or approve the use of a streaming device.

Collaborate with Selec to ensure necessary HMI support for RS485 communication.

Exclusions

Electrical wiring and internet provisioning at the client’s site are outside the vendor’s scope.

Third-party costs, such as server hosting fees beyond the first year, are not included and are subject to change in subsequent years.

Project Timeline

Hardware Procurement: 2 weeks

Software Development: 4 weeks

Installation and Testing: 1 week

Total Estimated Time: 7 weeks

Acceptance Criteria

Accurate milk level and temperature readings under stirred conditions.

Reliable data transmission to the web application.

Functional alarm notification system.

Seamless data export to Excel.

HMI integration with RS485 communication with support from Selec.

Display of live tank level data on a smart TV or a streaming device.

Full compliance with client requirements as outlined above.
